  ## Introduction

   This project was my final solo project that I completed in while at Turing! This project was a great learning experience as i got to implement complex logic to create a fully functional application using React and the NY Times api.

  ## Technologies

  - Javascript
  - React
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Router V6
  - XML
  


  ## Features

  This application fetches NY Times news data from an api and displays the data in organized rows. This application allows users to search and look through various new articles.

  ## Possible Future Extensions

  Some future extensions that i would like to add is an option to add favorite articles to a list with the option to delete and alter them.

  ## Set Up
  1. Fork and clone this repo.
  2. Type `cd` to move into the root directory.
  3. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page (you should see some boilerplate HTML displayed on the page).  `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server.  Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems. This command is not specific to Webpack; make note of it for future use. Have Fun!
